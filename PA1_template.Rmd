## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
steps <- data %>%
filter(!is.na(steps)) %>%
group_by(date) %>%

print
ggplot(steps, aes(x = steps)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "firebrick", binwidth = 1000) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Steps per day", x = "Steps per day", y = "Frequency")

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
ggplot(steps, aes(x = steps)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "firebrick", binwidth = 1000) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Steps per day", x = "Steps per day", y = "Frequency")

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
